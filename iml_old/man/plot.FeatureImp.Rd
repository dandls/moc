\title{Plot Feature Importance}
\usage{
\method{plot}{FeatureImp}(x, sort = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A FeatureImp R6 object}

\item{sort}{logical. Should the features be sorted in descending order? Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{...}{Further arguments for the objects plot function}
}
\value{
ggplot2 plot object
}
\description{
plot.FeatureImp() plots the feature importance results of a FeatureImp object.
}
\details{
The plot shows the importance per feature.

When n.repetitions in `FeatureImp$new` was larger than 1, then we get multiple importance estimates per feature.
The importances are aggregated and the plot shows the median importance per feature (as dots) and also the 90%-quantile, which 
helps to understand how much variance the computation has per feature.

\examples{
 
if (require("rpart")) {
# We train a tree on the Boston dataset:
data("Boston", package  = "MASS")
tree = rpart(medv ~ ., data = Boston)
y = Boston$medv
X = Boston[-which(names(Boston) == "medv")]
mod = Predictor$new(tree, data = X, y = y)

# Compute feature importances as the performance drop in mean absolute error
imp = FeatureImp$new(mod, loss = "mae")

# Plot the results directly
plot(imp)
