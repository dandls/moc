# iml: interpretable machine learning

`iml` is an R package that interprets the behaviour and explains
predictions of machine learning models. It implements model-agnostic
interpretability methods - meaning they can be used with any machine
learning model.

\<\<\<\<\<\<\< HEAD ![](iml.png) =======
<img src="inst/iml.png" height="200" />

> > > > > > > master Currently implemented:

  - Feature importance
  - Partial dependence plots
  - Individual conditional expectation plots (ICE)
  - Accumulated local effects
  - Tree surrogate
  - LocalModel: Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations
  - Shapley value for explaining single predictions

Read more about the methods in the [Interpretable Machine Learning
book](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/agnostic.html)

# Installation

The package can be installed directly from CRAN and the development
version from github:

``` r
# Stable version
install.packages("iml")
# Development version
devtools::install_github("christophM/iml")
```

# News

Changes of the packages can be accessed in the [NEWS
file](https://github.com/christophM/iml/blob/master/NEWS.md) shipped
with the package.

# Example

First we train a randomForest to predict the Boston median housing
value. How does lstat influence the prediction individually and on
average? (Accumulated local effects)

``` r
library("iml")
library("randomForest")
data("Boston", package  = "MASS")
rf = randomForest(medv ~ ., data = Boston, ntree = 50)
X =  Boston[which(names(Boston) != "medv")]
model = Predictor$new(rf, data = X, y = Boston$medv)
effect = FeatureEffects$new(model)
effect$plot(features = c("lstat", "age", "rm"))
```
