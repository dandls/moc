\title{Decision tree surrogate model}
\format{
\code{\link{R6Class}} object.
}
\description{
\code{TreeSurrogate} fits a decision tree on the predictions of a prediction model.
}
\section{Usage}{

\preformatted{
tree = TreeSurrogate$new(predictor, maxdepth = 2, tree.args = NULL)

plot(tree)
predict(tree, newdata)
tree$results
print(tree)
}
}

\section{Arguments}{


For TreeSurrogate$new():
\describe{
\item{predictor: }{(Predictor)\cr 
The object (created with Predictor$new()) holding the machine learning model and the data.}
\item{maxdepth: }{(`numeric(1)`)\cr The maximum depth of the tree. Default is 2.}
\item{tree.args: }{(named list)\cr Further arguments for \code{ctree}.}
}
}

\section{Details}{
  
A conditional inference tree is fitted on the predicted \eqn{\hat{y}} from the machine learning model and the data.
The \code{partykit} package and function are used to fit the tree. 
By default a tree of maximum depth of 2 is fitted to improve interpretability.

}

\section{Fields}{

\describe{
\item{maxdepth: }{(`numeric(1)`)\cr The maximum tree depth.}
\item{predictor: }{(Predictor)\cr The prediction model that was analysed.}
\item{r.squared: }{(`numeric(1|n.classes)`)\cr R squared measures how well the decision tree approximates the underlying model. 
It is calculated as 1 - (variance of prediction differences / variance of black box model predictions).
For the multi-class case, r.squared contains one measure per class.}
\item{results: }{(data.frame)\cr Data.frame with sampled feature X together with the leaf node information (columns .node and .path) 
and the predicted \eqn{\hat{y}} for tree and machine learning model (columns starting with .y.hat).}
\item{tree: }{(party)\cr The fitted tree. See also \link[partykit]{ctree}.}
}

\section{Methods}{

\describe{
\item{plot()}{method to plot the leaf nodes of the surrogate decision tree. See \link{plot.TreeSurrogate}.}
\item{predict()}{method to predict new data with the tree. See also \link{predict.TreeSurrogate}}
\item{\code{clone()}}{[internal] method to clone the R6 object.}
\item{\code{initialize()}}{[internal] method to initialize the R6 object.}
}

\examples{
if (require("randomForest")) {
# Fit a Random Forest on the Boston housing data set
data("Boston", package  = "MASS")
rf = randomForest(medv ~ ., data = Boston, ntree = 50)
# Create a model object
mod = Predictor$new(rf, data = Boston[-which(names(Boston) == "medv")]) 

# Fit a decision tree as a surrogate for the whole random forest
dt = TreeSurrogate$new(mod)

# Plot the resulting leaf nodes
plot(dt) 

# Use the tree to predict new data
predict(dt, Boston[1:10,])

# Extract the results
dat = dt$results
head(dat)


# It also works for classification
rf = randomForest(Species ~ ., data = iris, ntree = 50)
X = iris[-which(names(iris) == "Species")]
mod = Predictor$new(rf, data = X, type = "prob")

# Fit a decision tree as a surrogate for the whole random forest
dt = TreeSurrogate$new(mod, maxdepth=2)

# Plot the resulting leaf nodes
plot(dt) 

# If you want to visualise the tree directly:
plot(dt$tree)

# Use the tree to predict new data
set.seed(42)
iris.sample = X[sample(1:nrow(X), 10),]
predict(dt, iris.sample)
predict(dt, iris.sample, type = "class")

# Extract the dataset
dat = dt$results
head(dat)
