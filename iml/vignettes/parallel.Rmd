The `iml` package can now handle bigger datasets. 
Earlier problems with exploding memory have been fixed for `FeatureEffect`, `FeatureImp` and `Interaction`.
It's also possible now to compute `FeatureImp` and `Interaction` in parallel.
This document describes how.

First we load some data, fit a random forest and create a Predictor object.

```{r}
set.seed(42)
library("iml")
library("randomForest")
data("Boston", package  = "MASS")
rf = randomForest(medv ~ ., data = Boston, ntree = 10)
X = Boston[which(names(Boston) != "medv")]
predictor = Predictor$new(rf, data = X, y = Boston$medv)
```

## Going parallel

You need to install the `doParallel` or a similar framework to compute in parallel.
Before you can use parallelization to compute for example the feature importance on multiple CPU cores, you have to setup up a cluster. 
Fortunately, the `doParallel` makes it easy to setup and register a cluster:

```{r}
library("doParallel")
# Creates a cluster with 2 cores
cl = makePSOCKcluster(2)
# Registers cluster
registerDoParallel(cl)
```


Now we can easily compute feature importance in parallel. This means that the computation per feature is distributed among the 2 cores I specified earlier.

```{r}
imp = FeatureImp$new(predictor, loss = "mae", parallel = TRUE)
plot(imp)
```

That wasn't very impressive, let's actually see how much speed up we get by parallelization.

```{r}
system.time(FeatureImp$new(predictor, loss = "mae", parallel = FALSE))
system.time(FeatureImp$new(predictor, loss = "mae", parallel = TRUE))
```

A little bit of improvement, but not too impressive.
Parallelization is more useful in the case where the model uses a lot of features or where the feature importance computation is repeated more often to get more stable results.

```{r}
system.time(FeatureImp$new(predictor, loss = "mae", parallel = FALSE, n.repetitions = 20))
system.time(FeatureImp$new(predictor, loss = "mae", parallel = TRUE, n.repetitions = 20))
```

Here the parallel computation is twice as fast as the sequential computation of the feature importance.

The parallization also speeds up the computation of the interaction statistics:

```{r}
system.time(Interaction$new(predictor, parallel = FALSE))
system.time(Interaction$new(predictor, parallel = TRUE))
```


Same for `FeatureEffects`:

```{r}
system.time(FeatureEffects$new(predictor, parallel = FALSE))
system.time(FeatureEffects$new(predictor, parallel = TRUE))
```


Remember to stop the cluster in the end again.

```{r}
stopCluster(cl)
```
